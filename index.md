title: "Erlang Package Index & Package Manager"
---

Agner is a rebar-friendly Erlang package index and package manager inspired by Clojars and
Homebrew.

Essentially, Agner is an index of Erlang packages with some extra
capabilities such as versioning, downloads and so on.

Agner is a shorthand for *A Giant Nebula of Erlang Repositories*. It
also pays homage to the Danish statistician Agner Krarup Erlang.

Installation
------------

It is just a matter of a simple oneliner to get Agner installed:

<pre class="code"><code>curl https://github.com/agner/agner/raw/master/scripts/oneliner | sh</code></pre>

If you want to install latest release instead of HEAD, use this one:

<pre class="code"><code>curl https://github.com/agner/agner/raw/master/scripts/oneliner.release | sh</code></pre>
