Agner is a rebar-friendly Erlang package index inspired by Clojars and
Homebrew.

Essentially, Agner is an index of Erlang packages with some extra
capabilities such as versioning, downloads and so on.

Agner is a shorthand for *A Giant Nebula of Erlang Repositories*. It
also pays homage to the Danish statistician Agner Krarup Erlang.

Installation and Configuration
------------------------------

It is just a matter of a simple oneliner to get Agner installed:

     curl https://github.com/agner/agner/raw/master/scripts/oneliner | sh

If you want to install latest release instead of HEAD, use this one:

     curl https://github.com/agner/agner/raw/master/scripts/oneliner.release | sh

### Configuation

If your `/usr/local` isn't writeable to your user, either set your
`AGNER_PREFIX` variable to point to some writeable location or use
`sudo sh`.
