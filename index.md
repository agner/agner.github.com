Agner is a rebar-friendly Erlang package index inspired by Clojars and
Homebrew.

Essentially, Agner is an index of Erlang packages with some extra
capabilities such as versioning, downloads and so on.

Agner is a shorthand for *A Giant Nebula of Erlang Repositories*. It
also pays homage to the Danish statistician Agner Krarup Erlang.
